process into a seamless, AI-powered digital experience. 

With an intelligent chat assistant, integrated portals, 
smart reminders, and real-time progress tracking — students 
get onboarded faster, universities save resources, and 
admins gain full visibility through analytics.

Built with production-grade architecture (Streamlit, SQLAlchemy, 
SHA-256 auth), CampusAI is not just a prototype — it's a 
deployable, scalable SaaS solution ready for real campuses.
