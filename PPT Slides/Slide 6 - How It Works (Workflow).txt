Create a ultra-premium, visually stunning HORIZONTAL WORKFLOW FLOWCHART 
for a project called "CampusAI — Smart Student Onboarding Agent".

This is a step-by-step user journey showing how the platform works, 
flowing from LEFT to RIGHT in a single horizontal pipeline.

STYLE & AESTHETICS:
- Background: Deep dark space theme — dark navy blue (#0a0a2e) to 
  deep black-purple (#0d0921) gradient with scattered subtle stars, 
  tiny nebula clouds, and soft cosmic dust particles
- Cards: Frosted glassmorphism rounded rectangle cards with soft 
  inner glow and glowing neon borders
- Each step card has a DIFFERENT accent glow color:
  Step 1 = Electric Blue (#3b82f6)
  Step 2 = Vivid Purple (#8b5cf6)  
  Step 3 = Neon Cyan (#06b6d4)
  Step 4 = Emerald Green (#10b981)
  Step 5 = Warm Amber (#f59e0b)
  Step 6 = Golden Yellow (#eab308) with special celebration glow
- Arrows: Thick glowing gradient arrows between each card, flowing 
  left → right, with a subtle pulsing/animated look. Arrow color 
  should transition from blue on the left to gold on the right.
- Icons: Large 3D-style colorful emoji icons at the TOP of each card
- Step Numbers: Bold circular badge with step number (1, 2, 3...) 
  at the top-left corner of each card with matching accent color
- Typography: Clean bold white text for titles, light gray (#cbd5e1) 
  for description text, with subtle text-shadow glow
- Overall feel: Like a premium SaaS onboarding flow from a $10M 
  startup pitch deck — clean, modern, cinematic
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 widescreen, ultra high resolution 4K

LAYOUT:

TITLE at top center: 
"How It Works" in large bold white text with subtle glow
Small subtitle below: "Student Onboarding Workflow — 6 Simple Steps"
Top-right corner: "INNOVGENIUS" in bold white text

MAIN FLOWCHART — 6 cards in a single horizontal row, connected by 
glowing gradient arrows (➜) flowing left to right:

CARD 1 — 📱 SIGN UP & LOGIN
  "Student registers with name,"
  "email, course & year."  
  "Secure SHA-256 authentication."
  Border glow: Electric Blue

      ━━━➜

CARD 2 — 📊 SMART DASHBOARD
  "Personalized dashboard with"
  "progress bar, pending tasks"
  "& quick-action portal cards."
  Border glow: Vivid Purple

      ━━━➜

CARD 3 — 💬 AI CHAT ASSISTANT
  "Ask any question in natural"
  "language. AI detects intent &"
  "gives instant smart answers."
  Border glow: Neon Cyan

      ━━━➜

CARD 4 — 🌐 PORTAL ACTIONS
  "Pay fees, upload documents,"
  "activate LMS, apply for"
  "hostel — all in one place."
  Border glow: Emerald Green

      ━━━➜

CARD 5 — ⏰ TRACK & REMINDERS
  "Auto progress tracking across"
  "all stages. Smart deadline"
  "reminders & real-time updates."
  Border glow: Warm Amber

      ━━━➜

CARD 6 — 🎓 ONBOARDING COMPLETE!
  "All tasks done! Student is"
  "fully campus-ready. Admin"
  "monitors via analytics panel."
  Border glow: Golden Yellow (extra bright celebration glow, 
  add subtle sparkle/confetti particles around this card)

ADDITIONAL DESIGN DETAILS:
- Add a thin subtle horizontal line/track behind all 6 cards like a 
  progress rail/pipeline, glowing softly in gradient from blue to gold
- Each arrow between cards should be thick, glowing, and have a 
  slight gradient that transitions color matching the adjacent cards
- Cards should have equal width and height, perfectly aligned
- Add very subtle reflection/shadow below each card
- The background should have a few larger soft-glowing orbs/circles 
  in purple and blue for depth (like bokeh lights)
- Add a tiny checkmark ✓ badge on the bottom of each card
- Make card corners nicely rounded (16px radius feel)
- Text inside cards should be 3 short lines max, center-aligned
- The overall flow should feel like a journey/pipeline progressing 
  from start (blue/cold) to finish (gold/warm) — a color temperature 
  journey from cool to warm
- NO watermarks, NO stock photos, pure vector/infographic design
- Make it CLEAN, MINIMAL, PREMIUM — not cluttered
