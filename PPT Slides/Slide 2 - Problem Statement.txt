SLIDE 2 — PROBLEM STATEMENT

Content (add as paragraph text below the title):

Universities onboard thousands of students every year, yet the process 
remains fragmented, manual, and overwhelming. Students are forced to 
visit multiple offices, track scattered deadlines, and navigate unclear 
requirements for fee payment, document submission, LMS activation, and 
hostel allocation — all without a single unified platform.

This leads to missed deadlines, rejected documents, delayed enrollments, 
and an overall frustrating first impression of campus life. On the admin 
side, there is zero real-time visibility into student progress, resulting 
in repeated queries, overloaded helpdesks, and inefficient resource allocation.

CampusAI addresses this gap by providing an intelligent, AI-powered 
onboarding agent that guides every student from admission to classroom 
— step by step, in one place.
