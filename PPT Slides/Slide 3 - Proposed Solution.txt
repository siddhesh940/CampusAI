Content (add as paragraph text below the title):

CampusAI is a smart, AI-powered student onboarding platform built 
with Streamlit and Python. It provides a single unified dashboard 
where students can complete every onboarding step — from fee payment 
to LMS activation — without visiting multiple offices.

Key features of the platform:

• AI Chat Assistant — A rule-based NLP engine that instantly answers 
  student queries about fees, documents, LMS, hostel, orientation, 
  timetable, and mentor assignment using a knowledge base.

• Internal Portal Pages — Dedicated pages for Fee Payment, Document 
  Upload & Verification, LMS Activation, and Hostel Application — 
  all functional with one-click actions.

• Smart Dashboard — Real-time onboarding progress tracking with 
  KPI cards, a 4-stage progress bar, pending task checklist, and 
  auto-generated reminders.

• Admin Analytics Panel — Plotly-powered charts showing fee collection 
  status, onboarding stage distribution, student management table, 
  and escalation queue for unresolved issues.

• Secure Auth System — SHA-256 password hashing, role-based access 
  control (Student vs Admin), and admin registration gated by a 
  secret code.

• Database Layer — SQLAlchemy ORM with 5 models (User, Student, 
  ChatHistory, Reminder, Escalation), SQLite for development, 
  PostgreSQL-ready for production deployment.
